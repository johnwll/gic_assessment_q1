Welcome to Auto Driving Car Simulation!

Please enter the width and height of the simulation field in x y format:
You have created a field of 10 x 10.

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Please enter the name of the car:
Please enter initial position of car Nice Car A in x y Direction format:
Please enter the commands for car Nice Car A:
Your current list of cars are:
- Nice Car A, (1,2) N, FFRFFFFRRL

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Please enter the name of the car:
Please enter initial position of car Good Car B in x y Direction format:
Please enter the commands for car Good Car B:
Your current list of cars are:
- Nice Car A, (1,2) N, FFRFFFFRRL
- Good Car B, (7,8) W, FFLFFFFFFF

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Your current list of cars are:
- Nice Car A, (1,2) N, FFRFFFFRRL
- Good Car B, (7,8) W, FFLFFFFFFF

After simulation, the result is:
- Nice Car A, collides with Good Car B at (5,4) at step 7
- Good Car B, collides with Nice Car A at (5,4) at step 7

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Start over
[2] Exit
Thank you for running the simulation. Goodbye!
