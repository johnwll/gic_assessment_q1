Welcome to Auto Driving Car Simulation!

Please enter the width and height of the simulation field in x y format:
Width must be greater than zero.
Please enter the width and height of the simulation field in x y format:
You have created a field of 7 x 4.

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Please enter the name of the car:
Please enter initial position of car New Car in x y Direction format:
Position (-1,0) is out of the field bounds.
Please enter initial position of car New Car in x y Direction format:
Please enter the commands for car New Car:
Your current list of cars are:
- New Car, (0,0) N, FFRFF

Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
Please enter the name of the car:
